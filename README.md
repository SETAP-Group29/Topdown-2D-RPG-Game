## Design & Implementation Rationale
This game was a collaborate effort, for which most of us, is our first time doing this. We wanted a game that we could enjoy and play in our free time. We came to the decision that Unity was the best envrionment to develop a game like this. We came to the decision of a 2D fantasy game after being prompted to do a Grand Theft Auto meets Skyrim game.
